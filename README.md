# Sic Assembler using python

# SystemsProgrammingCourseProject

This project aims to create a simple assembler for a basic assembly language using Python. Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is closely related to machine code and allows direct control over a computer's hardware. In this project, we will design an assembler that can translate human-readable assembly code into machine code that can be executed by a computer's processor.
